  <p>The Funtional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) document's main part defines the primary and
    secondary entities which became famous as FRBR models. Years later Tom Delsey created a mapping
    between the 12 functions and the individual MARC elements.</p>

    Tom Delsey (2002)
    <em>Functional analysis of the MARC 21 bibliographic and holdings formats.</em> Tech. report,
    Library of Congress, 2002. Prepared for the Network Development and MARC Standards Office Library of Congress.
    Second Revision: September 17, 2003.

  <p>This page shows how these functions are supported by the records. The horizontal axis show the strength of
    the support: something on the left means that support is low so only small portion of the fields support a
    function are available in the records, something on the right means the support is strength. The bars
    represents a range of values. The vertical axis shows the number of records having values in the same range.</p>

  <p>It is experimental because it turned out, that the the mapping covers about 2000 elements (fields, subfields,
    indicatiors etc.), however on an average record there are max several hundred elements, which results that even
    in the best record has about 10-15% of the totality of the elements supporting a given function. So the tool
    doesn't shows you exact numbers, and the scale is not 0-100 but 0-[best score] which is different for every
    catalogue.</p>
