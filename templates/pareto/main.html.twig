  <h2>Field frequency distribution</h2>

  <p>These charts show how the field frequency patterns. Each chart shows a line which is the function of
    field frequency: on the x axis you can see the subfields ordered by the frequency (how many time a given
    subfield occured in the whole catalogue). They are ordered by frequency from the most frequent top 1%
    to the least frequent 1% subfields.
    The Y axis represents the cumulative occurrence (from 0% to 100%).
